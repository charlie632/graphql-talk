# GraphQL Talk

This is a talk or something I'm giving aboutn GQL.

## Installation

You need `yarn` to make it easier.

If you have yarn, just run `yarn` in the root of the project and everything will be installed. Otherwise, you have to:

- in root: `npm i`
- in each package: `npm i`

## Run

Just run `yarn start` or `npm start` in the root.

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the slides :)
